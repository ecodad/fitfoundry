# FitFoundry — System Requirements

This document covers everything needed to set up and run the full three-stage FitFoundry workflow: ProfileBuilder (Stage 1), FitFoundry (Stage 2), and LaunchKit (Stage 3).

---

## Common Requirements

These apply to all three stages.

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Cowork desktop app** | All browser automation, file operations, and AI execution run inside Cowork. Required for every stage. |
| **Workspace folder** | A local folder selected in Cowork at session start. All FitFoundry files and output must live here or in a subfolder. |
| **FitFoundry files** | `PROFILEBUILDER.md`, `FITFOUNDRY-WORKFLOW.md`, `LAUNCHKIT.md`, `CAREER-PROFILE-INTERVIEW.md`, `JOB-BOARD-SITE-NOTES.md`, `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` (template), `MY-PROFILE.md` (template), and the `sites/` folder. |
| **`.env` file** | Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `PROFILE_PATH`, `QUICK_REFERENCE_PATH`, and `OUTPUT_FOLDER`. See `SETUP.md`. |
| **Puppeteer MCP server** | Required for Stage 2 on all boards except Indeed and Dice. Puppeteer is not included with Cowork — it must be added as an MCP server. See Puppeteer Setup below. |

---

## Puppeteer Setup

Puppeteer is added to Cowork as an MCP server using the `@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer` package. It is not bundled with Cowork and must be added before FitFoundry Stage 2 will work on any Puppeteer-based board.

Cowork will guide you through the installation process. The simplest approach is to open a Cowork session and tell it you want to install the Puppeteer MCP server — it will walk you through the steps for your specific version and platform.

Node.js and npm must be present on your machine for the installation to complete. If they are not already installed, download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) first.

## Stage 1 — ProfileBuilder

ProfileBuilder is run once to generate your profile and quick reference. It has no connector or tool dependencies beyond Cowork itself.

| Requirement | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cowork | Yes | — |
| Resume file | No | Providing a `.docx` or `.pdf` resume allows ProfileBuilder to pre-fill answers and skip questions it can already infer. Recommended but not required. |

**Outputs:** `MY-PROFILE.md` and `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` (paths set in `.env`).

---

## Stage 2 — FitFoundry

FitFoundry requirements vary by job board. Boards not listed in the table below require no additional setup beyond Cowork and a completed Stage 1 profile.

**Prerequisites:** Completed `MY-PROFILE.md` and `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` from Stage 1, with board-specific search settings filled in.

### Per-Board Requirements

| Board | Scraping Method | Additional Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Climatebase | Puppeteer MCP server | None |
| Greentown Labs | Puppeteer MCP server | None |
| The Engine | Puppeteer MCP server | None |
| Y Combinator | Puppeteer MCP server | None |
| BEV Jobs (Breakthrough Energy) | Puppeteer MCP server | None |
| BEF Jobs (Breakthrough Energy) | Puppeteer MCP server | None |
| Formlabs | Puppeteer MCP server | None |
| Draper Laboratory | Puppeteer MCP server | None |
| 80,000 Hours | Puppeteer MCP server | Algolia App ID and API Key — public read-only keys retrieved from DevTools on `jobs.80000hours.org`. Add to `.env` and `QUICK-REFERENCE.md`. See `SETUP.md`. |
| LinkedIn | Claude in Chrome | Claude in Chrome browser extension installed and connected. Active LinkedIn account with session open in Chrome before starting. |
| Wellfound | Claude in Chrome | Claude in Chrome browser extension installed and connected. Active Wellfound account with session open in Chrome before starting. |
| Indeed | MCP connector | Indeed MCP connector active at session start. Cowork will prompt you to connect it if not already linked. |
| Dice | MCP connector | Dice MCP connector active at session start. Cowork will prompt you to connect it if not already linked. |

### Claude in Chrome — Setup Notes

The Claude in Chrome extension is required only for LinkedIn and Wellfound, both of which require an authenticated session. Puppeteer cannot bypass their login walls or CAPTCHA systems.

1. Install the Claude in Chrome extension from the Chrome Web Store.
2. Log into LinkedIn and/or Wellfound in Chrome before starting a Cowork session.
3. When Cowork prompts for a browser connection, click **Connect** in Chrome.

## Stage 3 — LaunchKit

LaunchKit generates tailored resumes and cover letters for jobs selected from FitFoundry results.

| Requirement | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cowork | Yes | — |
| Completed Stage 1 profile | Yes | LaunchKit reads `MY-PROFILE.md` to inform tailoring decisions. |
| FitFoundry results | Yes | Individual job report files (`.md`) in `OUTPUT_FOLDER`, generated by Stage 2. |
| Base resume(s) | Yes | One or more files in `.docx` or `.pdf` format, present in the workspace. Multiple files are treated as a pool — LaunchKit synthesizes from all of them. |
| Base cover letter(s) | Yes | One or more files in `.docx` or `.pdf` format, present in the workspace. Used as tone and structure reference. |
| docx skill | Yes | Built into Cowork. Used to generate `.docx` output files. No separate installation required. |

**Accepted input formats for base documents:** `.docx` and `.pdf` only.

**Output format:** `.docx` for both resume and cover letter. Edit in Word, Google Docs, or Claude Chat before submitting.

## First-Time Setup Checklist

Complete these steps before running ProfileBuilder for the first time.

1. Install the Cowork desktop app.
2. Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) if not already present (required for Puppeteer).
3. Add the Puppeteer MCP server — tell Cowork you want to install it and it will guide you through the process (see Puppeteer Setup above).
4. Copy the FitFoundry files to a local folder on your computer.
5. Open Cowork and select that folder as your workspace.
6. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `PROFILE_PATH`, `QUICK_REFERENCE_PATH`, and `OUTPUT_FOLDER`.
7. If you plan to use LinkedIn or Wellfound: install the Claude in Chrome extension and log into both services in Chrome.
8. If you plan to use Indeed or Dice: connect the relevant MCP connectors in Cowork settings.
9. If you plan to use 80,000 Hours: retrieve Algolia credentials from DevTools (see `SETUP.md`) and add them to `.env`.
10. Run **ProfileBuilder** (`PROFILEBUILDER.md`) to generate your profile and quick reference.
11. Open `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` and fill in the board-specific search settings for each board you plan to use.
12. Place your base resume(s) and cover letter(s) (`.docx` or `.pdf`) in the workspace folder.
13. Run **FitFoundry** (`FITFOUNDRY-WORKFLOW.md`) to start searching job boards.
14. Review results in `OUTPUT_FOLDER`, then run **LaunchKit** (`LAUNCHKIT.md`) for the jobs you want to pursue.
