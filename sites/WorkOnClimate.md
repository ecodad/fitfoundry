## Overview

Work on Climate is a Slack community (~35,000 members) for people working on climate solutions. Jobs are shared informally rather than through a structured board. High signal for climate ops/PM roles; community skews senior and mission-driven with a lower engineering-to-ops ratio than Climatebase.

**There is no scrapable job listing page.** The `/jobs` URL returns a 404.

## Access

Jobs are distributed via two channels:

1. **Slack `#job-board` channel** — members post directly; high volume, real-time
2. **Monthly newsletter** — `mailchi.mp/workonclimate.org/website-newsletter-signup`

## Monitoring

Manual monitoring only. No automation is possible.

- **Slack:** Check the `#job-board` channel weekly. Use Slack search for keywords like "program manager", "operations", "TPM", "director" to surface relevant posts without reading every message.
- **Newsletter:** Subscribe and review on arrival (monthly cadence).

## Known Issues & Quirks

- No structured data — job posts are freeform Slack messages. Titles, companies, and links are inconsistently formatted.
- Some posts link to Google Forms or personal emails rather than ATS systems — apply directly.
- Job posts are not archived indefinitely in free Slack workspaces. Check regularly to avoid missing time-sensitive postings.
