# ProfileBuilder — Career Profile Setup

**Paste this prompt into Cowork to create or update your FitFoundry profile. Run once before your first FitFoundry session, or re-run any time your situation or priorities change.**

---

## WORKFLOW PROMPT

```
Read CAREER-PROFILE-INTERVIEW.md and hold the full question set in context.

Read .env to load PROFILE_PATH and QUICK_REFERENCE_PATH. If .env is missing or either
variable is not set, use the defaults: PROFILE_PATH = ./MY-PROFILE.md and
QUICK_REFERENCE_PATH = ./QUICK-REFERENCE.md.

---

STEP 0 — RESUME CHECK

Ask the user:
  "Do you have a resume you'd like to provide? If so, please upload it or point me
  to its path in the workspace. I'll use it to pre-fill what I can and skip questions
  I can already answer."

If a resume is provided:
- Read it in full.
- Extract the following where present:
    - Current and past job titles, companies, tenure
    - Key skills and technical competencies
    - Industries and domains
    - Education and credentials
    - Location (if listed)
    - Any stated objective or summary

Hold extracted resume content in context. Do not generate the profile yet.

If no resume is provided, proceed to Step 1 with interview-only mode.

---

STEP 1 — INTERVIEW MODE

Ask the user:
  "Would you like the Quick Interview (~5 minutes, covers the essential matching
  signals) or the Full Interview (~20 minutes, adds culture, motivations, and
  work style for better scoring)?"

Wait for their answer before proceeding.

Set MODE = Quick or Full.

---

STEP 2 — CONDUCT THE INTERVIEW

Work through the question set from CAREER-PROFILE-INTERVIEW.md for the selected MODE.

Rules:
- Ask one topic block at a time, not one question at a time. Group naturally
  related questions (e.g., "Role and Level" is one exchange).
- If the resume already answers a question clearly, state what you inferred and
  ask the user to confirm or correct — do not ask the question from scratch.
  Example: "Your resume shows a Senior TPM title at two companies — is that the
  seniority level you're targeting, or are you open to Director-level roles?"
- If the resume partially answers something, use it as a starting point and ask
  for the missing piece only.
- If the answer is genuinely ambiguous from the resume, ask the full question.
- Do not skip questions outright — every question either gets answered by resume
  inference + confirmation, or by asking the user directly.
- Keep a running internal list of all confirmed answers as the interview proceeds.

After the final question block, say:
  "That's everything I need. Give me a moment to put your profile together."

---

STEP 3 — CONFIRM EXTRACTED ANSWERS

Before generating any files, present a compact summary of all inferred and stated
answers organized by section. Flag any that feel uncertain or that may need review.

Ask the user:
  "Does this look right? Correct anything before I generate your files."

Wait for confirmation or corrections. Apply corrections to the answer set.

---

STEP 4 — GENERATE MY-PROFILE.md

Write the file to PROFILE_PATH.

Use the following structure:

---

# [Name] — Career Profile

*Generated by ProfileBuilder on [YYYY-MM-DD]. Update this file any time your
situation or priorities change — FitFoundry adapts automatically.*

---

## Professional Identity

[2–3 sentences describing who the candidate is professionally — function, industry,
level, and what they're known for. Written in third person for use by the matching
agent. Synthesized from interview Q13–15 if full interview, or from resume summary
and role/domain answers if quick interview only.]

---

## Target Roles

- **Titles:** [List of target job titles]
- **Type:** [IC / Manager / Either]
- **Seniority:** [Target level — and whether open to a step down]

---

## Skills and Expertise

**Emphasize in search:**
[Top 5–7 skills, ranked by strength. These are what the agent leads with when
assessing fit.]

**Suppress from search:**
[Skills the candidate can do but does not want to be hired for. The agent will
discount listings that primarily require these.]

---

## Domain and Industry

**Worked in:** [Industries and domains from background]
**Targeting:** [Industries and domains for the search]

---

## What Meaningful Work Looks Like

[Full interview only — 3–5 sentences synthesized from Q16–18 and Q24–26 on what
the candidate needs to be engaged: mission type, problem type, autonomy level,
etc. If quick interview only, write: "Full interview not completed — scoring will
rely on hard matching signals only."]

---

## Culture and Environment

[Full interview only — 3–5 sentences on preferred culture, management style,
org size, and pace synthesized from Q19–23. If quick interview only, omit this
section.]

---

## Career Direction

[Full interview only — 2–3 sentences on 3–5 year goal and skills to develop,
from Q27–29. If quick interview only, omit this section.]

---

## Hard Filters

These are absolute constraints. A job that fails any of these is not a fit
regardless of title or score.

- **Location:** [City/region + remote/relocation stance]
- **Salary floor:** [Target base salary minimum]
- **Authorization:** [Visa sponsorship needed — yes/no; clearance willingness]
- **Start date:** [Target start or urgency level]
- **Role type exclusions:** [e.g., pure IC engineering, management-only, etc.]
- **Sector exclusions:** [Industries or org types to avoid entirely]

---

## Companies and Organizations

**Prioritize:** [Specific companies or org types to favor — e.g., mission-driven
nonprofits, pre-IPO startups, national labs]
**Avoid:** [Specific companies already applied to, or org types to skip]

---

## Framing Notes

[Full interview only — how to contextualize gaps, pivots, or non-linear history
when assessing fit, from Q30–31. If quick interview only, omit this section.]

---

*Source: ProfileBuilder interview [YYYY-MM-DD] | Resume: [filename if provided, else "not provided"]*

---

STEP 5 — GENERATE QUICK-REFERENCE.md

Write the file to QUICK_REFERENCE_PATH.

Pre-fill everything that can be derived from the interview. Leave board-specific
search settings as labeled placeholders — the user fills these in as they set up
each board.

Use the following structure:

---

# Quick Reference — [Name]

*Generated by ProfileBuilder on [YYYY-MM-DD]. The agent reads this file at the
start of every FitFoundry session to calibrate scoring and apply search preferences.*

---

## Candidate Profile

- **Name:** [Name]
- **Location:** [City/region; note if open to remote and scope]
- **Default search location:** [City, State — used as location parameter in job board searches]
- **Background:** [2–3 sentence summary of experience — function, industry, years, notable employers]
- **Target sectors:** [Comma-separated list]
- **Goal:** [One sentence on what the candidate is optimizing for]
- **Seniority:** [e.g., Senior IC, Manager, Director]
- **Not a fit:** [Hard exclusions — role types, sectors, salary floor, geography]
- **Full profile:** [PROFILE_PATH value]

---

## Scoring Calibration

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 9–10 | Dream job — near-perfect alignment | Individual file |
| 7–8 | Strong fit — worth pursuing | Individual file |
| 6 | Partial fit — one significant gap | Individual file |
| 5 | Partial fit — multiple gaps | Master list only |
| 4 | Marginal | Master list only |
| ≤ 3 | Poor fit | Skip |

*Adjust thresholds to match your current situation. Actively hunting → lower
individual file threshold to 5. Passive and selective → raise it to 7.*

## Notes

[Use this section for anything the agent should know — boards to skip this cycle,
companies already applied to, active applications to avoid duplicating, etc.]

---

STEP 6 — WRAP UP

Confirm both files have been written, and tell the user:

"Your profile is ready. A few things to do before your first FitFoundry run:

1. Open [QUICK_REFERENCE_PATH] and fill in the Board-Specific Search Settings
   for each board you plan to use. Leave any boards you won't use blank.
2. If you retrieved Algolia credentials for 80,000 Hours, add them to the
   Credentials section and to your .env file.
3. When you're ready to search, paste the contents of FITFOUNDRY-WORKFLOW.md
   into a new Cowork session."

If the user provided a resume, add:
"I've noted your resume filename in the profile. Keep it accessible in the
workspace — LaunchKit will use it later when generating application materials."
```

---

## NOTES

- ProfileBuilder is designed to be run once and re-run when priorities change.
  It overwrites PROFILE_PATH and QUICK_REFERENCE_PATH on each run — back up
  your existing files first if you want to preserve them.
- The quick interview is sufficient for basic FitFoundry matching. The full
  interview improves ranking quality for borderline jobs and culture-heavy roles.
- Board-specific search settings in the Quick Reference must be filled in manually
  after the interview — ProfileBuilder cannot infer which keywords work best on
  a given board without prior run experience.
