**Skills and Domain**
4. List your top 5–7 technical or functional skills, starting with the strongest.

6. What industries or domains have you worked in, and which are you targeting?

**Logistics**
7. What is your target base salary range?

## Full Interview (~20 minutes)

*Adds culture, motivations, and work style — the deeper signals that distinguish a good match from the right one. Complete the Quick Interview first, then continue here.*

**Your Professional Identity**

13. In a few sentences, how would you describe your professional identity — not your title, but what you actually do and what you're known for?
14. What are the two or three things you do better than most people at your level?
15. Have you ever been the go-to person for something at work? What was it?

**What You're Looking For**

16. What does meaningful work look like to you? What has to be present for you to feel genuinely engaged?
17. Rank these in order of personal importance: compensation, mission alignment, growth opportunity, work-life balance, team quality, autonomy, stability.
18. Are there causes, sectors, or types of problems that feel especially important to you right now?

**Culture and Environment**

19. Describe the culture where you've been most productive. What did it feel like day-to-day?
20. Describe the best manager you've had. What made them effective?
21. Have you ever left a role primarily because of culture or leadership? Without naming names — what went wrong?
22. Do you thrive in ambiguity and fast-moving environments, or do you prefer more structure and stability?
23. What organization size tends to suit you best — startup, mid-size, large enterprise, academic or research institution?

**Track Record**

24. What's the accomplishment you're most proud of — the one that best represents what you're capable of?
25. Describe a project where you had significant ownership. What was the outcome?
26. What types of problems do you find yourself solving repeatedly, across different roles or organizations?

27. Where would you like to be professionally in three to five years?
28. Are there skills you're actively trying to develop or use more in your next role?
29. Is there a type of work you've always been curious about but never pursued?

**Framing and Gaps**

30. Are there gaps, pivots, or elements of your background that tend to get misread by recruiters? How would you want them framed?
31. Is there anything about you that consistently gets overlooked that you'd want a job matching system to know?

## Notes for the Matching Agent

After the interview, extract and flag:

- **Hard filters** — salary floor, location, authorization, start date, role type
- **Target signals** — titles, industries, seniority, skills to emphasize
- **Exclusions** — skills to suppress, sectors to avoid, dealbreaker culture traits
- **Fit signals** (full interview only) — management style preferences, organization size, mission alignment, work environment
- **Framing notes** — how to contextualize gaps or non-linear history in matching

*The quick interview is sufficient for basic matching. The full interview improves ranking and fit scoring.*
